# Hackathon APIs Edition

As a developer advocate at Agora, I am always looking to collaborate with Advocates from other companies. Wouldn't it be nice to have a website I can visit to find out advocates?


## Challenge 1 - For Backend Devs
Build an API that outputs a list of developer advocates with their details such as where they work, social links, bio, etc. Example API response bellow.

### Project Requirements
Your API should at a minimum have these 2 endpoints







```http
/advocates
/advocates/:username
```

Your API should be searchable (By username) paginated.
Ex:

```http
  /advocates/?query=arafat
```
